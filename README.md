# Magic Lambda Hyperlambda

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.hyperlambda.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.hyperlambda)

Hyperlambda parser and creator for [Magic](https://github.com/polterguy/magic). More specifically, this project provides you with two
slots.

* __[hyper2lambda]__ - Transforms a piece of Hyperlambda (text) to a lambda hierarchy.
* __[lambda2hyper]__ - Transforms a lambda hierarchy to Hyperlambda (text).

Using these slots, you can both easily create, serialize, and parse Hyperlambda to lambda, and vice versa.
