# Magic Lambda Hyperlambda

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.hyperlambda.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.hyperlambda)

Hyperlambda parser and creator for [Magic](https://github.com/polterguy/magic). More specifically, this project provides you with two
slots.

* __[hyper2lambda]__ - Transforms a piece of Hyperlambda (text) to a lambda hierarchy.
* __[lambda2hyper]__ - Transforms a lambda hierarchy to Hyperlambda (text).

Using these slots, you can both easily create, serialize, and parse Hyperlambda to lambda, and vice versa.

## License

Although most of Magic's source code is publicly available, Magic is _not_ Open Source or Free Software.
You have to obtain a valid license key to install it in production, and I normally charge a fee for such a
key. You can [obtain a license key here](https://servergardens.com/buy/).
Notice, 5 hours after you put Magic into production, it will stop functioning, unless you have a valid
license for it.
