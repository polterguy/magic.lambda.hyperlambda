# Magic Lambda Hyperlambda

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.hyperlambda.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.hyperlambda)

Hyperlambda parser and creator for [Magic](https://github.com/polterguy/magic). More specifically, this project provides you with two
slots.

* __[hyper]__ - Transforms a piece of Hyperlambda (text) to a lambda hierarchy.
* __[lambda]__ - Transforms a lambda hierarchy to Hyperlambda (text).

Using these slots, you can both easily create, serialize, and parse Hyperlambda to lambda, and vice versa.

## License

Magic is licensed as Affero GPL. This means that you can only use it to create Open Source solutions.
If this is a problem, you can contact at thomas@gaiasoul.com me to negotiate a proprietary license if
you want to use the framework to build closed source code. This will allow you to use Magic in closed
source projects, in addition to giving you access to Microsoft SQL Server adapters, to _"crudify"_
database tables in MS SQL Server. I also provide professional support for clients that buys a
proprietary enabling license.
